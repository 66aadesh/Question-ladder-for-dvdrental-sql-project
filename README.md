# 📊 SQL Practice Using the DVD Rental Database

Welcome! I'm **Aditya Dixit**, a **Data Analytics and Data Engineering Enthusiast** passionate about problem-solving and continuous learning.

This project is the result of my effort to build a structured and progressive SQL practice system using the classic `dvdrental` sample database. With guidance from **ChatGPT** and a foundation from Jose Portilla's Udemy course, I designed and solved my own LeetCode-style SQL challenges to strengthen query logic, optimization skills, and real-world application.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- 💡 **Self-Generated Challenges**: Created and solved SQL problems with increasing difficulty.
- 🛠️ **Hands-on Query Building**: Wrote optimized, well-structured SQL queries on PostgreSQL.
- 📚 **Concept Coverage**: Joins, Aggregations, CTEs, Subqueries, and Window Functions.
- 🧠 **AI-Assisted Learning**: Used ChatGPT to mimic technical interviews and code reviews.
- 🗺️ **Progressive Structure**: Designed to simulate real SQL interviews and practical tasks.

## 📁 Difficulty Levels

The questions are organized into four difficulty tiers to support structured learning:

- 🟢 **Easy** – Basic SELECTs, filters, ordering, and simple JOINs
- 🟡 **Medium** – Aggregations, multi-table joins, filtering groups, nested queries
- 🟠 **Hard** – Window functions, advanced joins, performance tuning, edge cases
- 🔴 **Very Hard** – Real-world case-style challenges, optimization, multi-step logic

Each tier is clearly labeled within the `sql/` folder.
