15. **Find the most rented movie.**
    - Output: `title`, `rental_count`
- Answer: -
    
    Great effort! You're on the right track, but there are a few syntax and logical errors to correct. Let's go through them step by step.
    
    ```sql
    my answer-
    
    SELECT title, COUNT(renatal.rental_id) AS rental_count FROM film
    JOIN inventory ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
    JOIN rental ON rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
    GROUP BY rental.rental_id
    ORDER BY DESC
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ### **Errors in Your Query:**
    
    1. **Typo in Table Alias**
        - You wrote `COUNT(renatal.rental_id)`, but it should be `COUNT(rental.rental_id)`.
    2. **Incorrect `GROUP BY` Clause**
        - You're grouping by `rental.rental_id`, but since you want to count rentals **per movie**, you should group by `film.title`.
    3. **Syntax Error in `ORDER BY`**
        - The correct syntax is `ORDER BY rental_count DESC`, not `ORDER BY DESC`.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Corrected Query:**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT film.title, COUNT(rental.rental_id) AS rental_count
    FROM film
    JOIN inventory ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
    JOIN rental ON rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
    GROUP BY film.title
    ORDER BY rental_count DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ### **Explanation of Fixes:**
    
    ✅ **Corrected the table alias:** Changed `renatal.rental_id` to `rental.rental_id`.
    
    ✅ **Fixed `GROUP BY`:** Now it groups by `film.title` so we get rentals per movie, not per rental.
    
    ✅ **Fixed `ORDER BY`:** `ORDER BY rental_count DESC` correctly sorts by the highest rental count.
    
    ✅ **Added `LIMIT 1`:** This ensures we get **only the most rented movie** instead of a full ranking.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Your Thought Process:**
    
    - You correctly **joined the right tables**: `film`, `inventory`, and `rental`. ✅
    - You knew that **counting `rental_id`** would give rental frequency. ✅
    - You knew **ordering by rental count** is needed. ✅
    
    💡 **Key Learning Points:**
    
    - **Think about grouping carefully**: If you're counting per movie, group by `title`, not `rental_id`.
    - **Watch out for typos**: Small spelling mistakes (`renatal` instead of `rental`) can cause errors.
    - **SQL syntax matters**: `ORDER BY DESC` needs to specify a column (`ORDER BY rental_count DESC`).
    
    You're getting **really close** to writing perfect queries. Keep going! 🚀
    
16. **List the top 5 cities with the highest number of customers.**
    - Output: `city`, `customer_count`
- Answer: -
    
    ```sql
    SELECT city.city, COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count FROM customer
    JOIN address ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
    JOIN city ON city.city_id = address.city_id
    GROUP BY city.city
    ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC --ORDER BY customer_count DESC for clarity
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

17. **Retrieve all movies and their respective categories.**
    - Output: `title`, `category_name`
- Answer: -
    
    ```sql
    SELECT title, category.name FROM film
    JOIN film_category ON film.film_id = film_category.film_id
    JOIN category ON film_category.category_id = category.category_id
    ```
    
    ---
    
18. **Calculate the average rental duration for all movies.**
    - Output: `average_rental_duration`
- Answer: -
    
    ```sql
    
    SELECT AVG(rental_duration) AS average_rental_duration
    FROM film
    GROUP BY film_id
    ORDER BY average_rental_duration DESC
    ```
    
    You're very close, and I love how you're applying SQL concepts! However, there's **one key mistake** that needs to be fixed.

    ### **Issues in Your Query:**
    
    1. **Unnecessary `GROUP BY film_id`**
        - The `GROUP BY film_id` is **not needed** because you want the **overall** average rental duration, not per movie.
        - `GROUP BY` is used when you want separate averages **for each movie**, but here you need a **single** value.
    2. **Incorrect `ORDER BY`**
        - Since we are computing a **single** average value, `ORDER BY` is unnecessary because there's only **one row** in the output.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Corrected Query:**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(rental_duration) AS average_rental_duration
    FROM film;
    
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ### **Why This Works:**
    
    ✅ **Removes `GROUP BY`** so the query calculates **one** average value for all movies.
    
    ✅ **Removes `ORDER BY`** because there's **only one result**, so no need to sort.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Your Thought Process (and How to Improve It)**
    
    ✅ You **correctly identified** that `AVG(rental_duration)` should be used.
    
    ✅ You knew the **`film` table** stores rental duration data.
    
    🔹 You **over-applied `GROUP BY`** when it wasn't needed.
    
    🔹 You added `ORDER BY`, which isn't necessary for a single-row result.
    
    💡 **Key Takeaway:**
    
    👉 Use `GROUP BY` only if you need averages **per category** (e.g., per movie).
    
    👉 If you're calculating a **single overall metric**, `GROUP BY` isn't needed.
    
    You're doing **really well!** Keep up the amazing work! 🚀🔥

19. **Find the total revenue generated by rentals.**
    - Output: `total_revenue`
- Answer: -
    
    ```sql
    
    SELECT SUM(amount) FROM payment AS total_revenue
    ```
    
    ---
    
20. **List all movies rented by customer ID 15.**
    - Output: `title`, `rental_date`
- Answer: -
    
    ```sql
    --my asnwer
    
    SELECT film.title, rental_date FROM rental
    JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = rental.customer_id
    JOIN inventory ON inventory.inventory_id = rental.inventory_id
    JOIN film ON film.film_id = inventory.film_id
    WHERE customer.customer_id = 15
    
    --ChatGPT
    
    SELECT film.title, rental.rental_date 
    FROM rental
    JOIN inventory ON inventory.inventory_id = rental.inventory_id
    JOIN film ON film.film_id = inventory.film_id
    WHERE rental.customer_id = 15;

21. **Identify customers who haven’t rented any movies.**
    - Output: `customer_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`
- Answer: -
    
    ```sql
    
    SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name FROM customer
    WHERE customer.customer_id NOT IN rental.customer_id
    ```
    
    Great effort! You're thinking in the right direction. Let's go step by step and fix the error.
    
    ---
    
    ### ❌ **What Went Wrong?**
    
    1. **Syntax Issue**:
        - `NOT IN rental.customer_id` is incorrect.
        - You need to use **a subquery** inside `NOT IN` to fetch `customer_id` values from the `rental` table.
    2. **Better Approach**:
        - Use `NOT EXISTS` or `LEFT JOIN ... WHERE rental.customer_id IS NULL`.
        - `NOT EXISTS` is usually more efficient.
    
    ---
    
    ### ✅ **Corrected Query (Using `NOT IN`)**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name
    FROM customer
    WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM rental);
    
    ```
    
    🔹 **Fixes applied:**
    
    - Used a **subquery** inside `NOT IN`.
    - `DISTINCT customer_id` ensures better performance.
    
    ---
    
    ### 🚀 **Alternative (Using `NOT EXISTS`)**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name
    FROM customer c
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM rental r WHERE r.customer_id = c.customer_id
    );
    
    ```
    
    🔹 **Why This is Better?**
    
    - **More efficient** in large datasets.
    - `NOT EXISTS` stops checking once it finds a match (unlike `NOT IN`).
    
    ---
    
    ### 🔥 **Best Approach (Using `LEFT JOIN`)**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
    FROM customer c
    LEFT JOIN rental r ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
    WHERE r.customer_id IS NULL;
    
    ```
    
    🔹 **Why `LEFT JOIN`?**
    
    - Finds all customers and brings rental data (if exists).
    - If `r.customer_id` is `NULL`, it means the customer **never rented a movie**.

    ### 🌟 **Final Thoughts**
    
    You're making great progress! 🚀
    
    Your logic was correct, just needed some syntax adjustments.
    
    Keep solving questions, and don't hesitate to experiment with different solutions. **You're improving every day!** 💪😊

22. **Find the movie category with the highest average rental duration.**
    - Output: `category_name`, `average_duration`
- Answer: -
    
    ```sql
    SELECT name AS category_name, AVG(film.rental_duration) AS average_duration FROM category
    JOIN film_category ON film_category.category_id = category.category_id
    JOIN film ON film.film_id = film_category.film_id
    GROUP BY category.name
    ORDER BY average_duration DESC
    
    ```

23. **Determine the staff member who has processed the most rentals.**
    - Output: `staff_id`, `rental_count`
- Answer: -
    
    ```sql
    
    SELECT staff.staff_id, COUNT(rental.rental_id) AS rental_count FROM staff
    JOIN rental ON rental.staff_id = staff.staff_id
    GROUP BY staff.staff_id
    ORDER BY rental_count DESC
    ```
    
    ---
    
24. **List all movies with more than 5 copies in inventory.**
    - Output: `title`, `copy_count`
- Answer: -
    
    ```sql
    
    SELECT film.title, COUNT(inventory.inventory_id) AS copy_count FROM film
    JOIN inventory ON film.film_id = inventory.film_id
    GROUP BY film.title
    HAVING COUNT(inventory.inventory_id)>5
    ORDER BY copy_count DESC
    
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ### 🛠 **Suggested Improvement:**
    
    🔹 **Fix the `HAVING` Clause** → PostgreSQL **doesn’t recognize `copy_count` directly in HAVING**, because it’s an alias. Instead, you need to reference `COUNT(inventory.inventory_id)`.
    
25. **Find the total number of movies in each category.**
    - Output: `category_name`, `film_count`
- Answer: -

    JOIN film_category ON film_category.category_id = category.category_id
    JOIN film ON film.film_id = film_category.film_id
    GROUP BY category.name
    ORDER BY film_count DESC
    ```

    - Output: `customer_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`
- Answer: -
    
    ```sql
    SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
    FROM rental r
    JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
    JOIN customer c ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT i.store_id) > 1;
    
    ```
